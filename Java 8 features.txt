Java 8 features 

1. Functional Programming
2. JavaScript engine
3. New API for Date time manipulation
4. Stream API 


Functional interface
-------------------------------------------
If interface contains only one abstract method,then it is called as functional interface
Ex- Runnable,Callable, Comparable

To call lambda expression functional interface is needed 














Lambda expression 
-------------------------------------------
(parameter list)  ->lambda body

It is an anonymous function 
1. No name
2. No modifier
3. No return type 
Without Functional interface u cannot use it 

() ->
{

SYSOUT("Test");
}

Advantages
-----------------------

1. reduce lines of code
2. sequential and parallel execution
3. to call stream API 


Stream API 
----------------------------------------------
These stream are related to collection framework 
To process group of Objects we need to have stream API


To reduce line of code
To reduce redundancy
